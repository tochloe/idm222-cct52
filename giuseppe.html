    <h3>Giuseppe & Sons</h3>

    <p>Italian dining, definitely not for those with a weak wallet. One of Philly’s favorite date places, Giuseppe & Sons is at the heart of Center City with most of the other fine dining gems of Philadelphia. Walking into the vestibule reveals an elegant basement bar, the dim lighting sets the tone for the night. I know this is called “Let’s Grab Lunch” and this is definitely not lunch, but it is for sure a meal you don’t want to miss. Finding parking is hard but finding what you want to eat here is even harder. There are so many things to choose from and from what I’ve had so far, they’re all so good!</p>
<p>Both times I have been here were to celebrate my friends’ birthday, and I can say for sure it is such a nice gesture to be invited here for a nice girls’ night dinner. Birthday dinners are normally complimented by a sparkler on a dessert of your choice; you still need to pay for the sweet treat though the gesture is nice.  Not only are the vibes of the seating area very relaxing and romantic, even the washroom is well designed for the diners to freshen up (even the faucets are unique and well picked). </p>

<p>Funny enough, the two birthday girls I celebrated are some of the pickiest eaters I’ve met so for them to enjoy  pasta in this price bracket says a lot about the food. It’s one thing for me to like it - I’ll eat anything - but for them to enjoy their meal as well is satisfying as well. </p>
