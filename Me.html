    <p> <strong>  Welcome, I am Chloe! I was raised on Hong Kongese and Vietnamese cuisine based in Philly! </strong> <br>
        Growing up in a city notorious for its food scene, I am able to experience the culinary culture the world has to offer. I know I’ve made it when people ask me for food recommendations and suggestions for what to order. Despite having a novel of allergies (thank you pollen) I don’t eat to survive, I eat like it's an art. With more room in my stomach than storage for photos, I would like to share my eating adventure with you! </p>
