        <p>Dollar Taco was my favorite thing to gate-keep. Once a week, on a random day, Loco Pez posts on Instagram announcing Dollar Taco - a deal where all tacos are only $1. A steal like that should be a secret but slowly, everything good must be shared. What used to be a 30 minute wait became a two hour wait, regardless of the recent hype, it will always be worth it. In this economy the dollar taco is more than just a budget meal for college students in the area, it fosters the West Philly community with their love of tacos and an excuse to go out. Its lowly lit seating area paired with their saloon decor complemented by the orange lighting and the colorful paper hanging on the walls transports you to another dimension. As someone who has been going there since I was 18, it was what I imagined an average bar to feel like when I would go to visit them when I turned 21. The low lighting makes the experience feel more intimate, the loud music and occasional live DJs brings diners to lean in closer for conversation further building on the romance of the table.</p>
        <p>Loco Pez’s Dollar Taco is a core memory for me and my friend groups. It’s my favorite thing to introduce to my university friends, and without it, I don’t think that I would have had such a good freshman year experience in college. Something about its warmth and familiarity draws me back every week. My first outing with new friends was at Loco Pez’s dollar Taco and we try to go back every week, we yearn for it. $1 tacos that not only are a good deal but also taste amazing? Why wouldn’t you go?</p>
        <p>My favorites would be the camorones or al pastor tacos. The shrimp is lightly battered and fried and served with sour cream and the pork slices are complemented with pineapple married with salsa verde and lime finds its way to my top favorite meals ever. To each their own; they have options for everyone, a strong variety of halal and vegetarian options allows most diners with dietary restrictions find something to enjoy.</p>
        <p>Although recently, they have changed their tortilla to corn tortillas instead of their classic flour ones, as someone with a corn allergy who would regularly dine with someone with an egg allergy, we cannot enjoy this anymore. The feeling of longing is only intensified for a mourning of what we once considered a tradition.
