        <p>When I mention this iconic furniture design store, the first thing that will come to your mind will be either its minimalistic approach to home design or their Swedish Meatballs. Do we as a society realize how big of an impact it is for a food court of a store that is not meant to distribute food products? Swedish meatballs, considered a delicacy for elementary school me after a long afternoon or window shopping with my parents in all 12 kitchen set ups, has continued its streak for reliability whenever I end up back there for bathroom recovery duty or last minute dorm room supply searching.</p>
        <p>I zone out mid-path thinking about the Lingonberry jam and the gravy. It really shouldn’t be this good. My mom’s utter disappointment when she realized I had never outgrown this phase helps hold me back for a little bit until we drive by the storefront and I go on about how we should go again. </p>
