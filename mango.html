        <h3>Mango Mango</h3>
        <p>It’s 10pm and we just left the concert where we stood for 2-3 hours straight and I side-eye slowly to my friend and he knows what I’m about to say. “Mango Mango?” “Chloe it’s 10:45pm on a Tuesday night.”</p>

        <p>Who would I be without Mango Mango? Without my go-to sweet treat spot after every Chinatown dinner I have attended. The mango shaved ice I would like to say, has saved my life. The closest thing I can get to Hong Kongese desserts, they offer the traditional teas and hot sago desserts as well blending the Western preferences with flavors like cookies ‘n cream and tiramisu. Do I know it’s a franchise and they get their cakes shipped to them frozen and they don’t truly bake them in house? Yes. But I will always be a loyal consumer to Mango Mango. The grasp it has on me for me to have a constant craving for it no matter the time or weather should be studied. It’s an addiction. </p>

        <p>Aside from myself, I LOVE when my friends invite me to share a shaved ice with them. I love watching their eyes light up seeing the size of the bowl. Their amusement reading the options on the menu and their pure excitement when they see the server coming. It’s exciting to me just to see their reactions.</p>
